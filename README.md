## Overview

Implemented a prototype for this PA, including GUI and most frontend logic.
**except** several critical parts left to students:

- All midpoint algorithm as left to students to implement;
- Frontend logic for poly-lines and polygons are also considered critical part
  because they can be implemented only with frontend logic by stacking vertex buffers of multiple line segments;

The program has reserved TODOs for students in proper location.

ALL README FILES IN FUTURE PAS SHOULD ALSO BE IN THE SAME FORMAT AS THIS ONE.

THIS TEMPLATE IS JUST FOR YOUR REFERENCE AND A QUICK START.
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO WRITE YOUR OWN PROGRAM FROM SCRATCH (I.E., NOT USING THIS TEMPLATE).
HOWEVER, THE MOUSE AND KEYBOARD FUNCTIONALITIES SHOULD BE THE SAME AS SPECIFIED IN THIS README.

## Features Implemented

- [x] P1: Line segment
    - [x] Slope m < -1
    - [x] -1 <= m < 0
    - [x] 0 <= m <= 1
    - [x] 1 < m
    - [x] Vertical
- [x] P2: Ploy-line
- [ ] P3: Polygon
- [ ] P4: Circle
- [ ] P5: Ellipse
- [ ] P6: Cubic curve

## Usage

If your program has more functionalities not mentioned in the manual,
you may write their usage here.

If your program failed to obey the required mouse/keyboard usage,
you may write your own setting here.
In this case, penalties may apply.

## Appendix

Please include any other stuff you would like to mention in this section.
E.g., your suggestion on possible combinations of cubic curve parameters in this programming assignment.
